# Sprint 2 Retrospective

## Reflection

### What Went Well
*   **Applying Feedback**: Switching to H2 for tests immediately improved the reliability of our testing process and CI pipeline.
*   **Architecture**: Refactoring to use `NoteService` improved the separation of concerns and made the codebase more maintainable.

### What Could Be Improved
*   *(Placeholder: Add any observations about challenges faced during this sprint)*

## Key Lessons Learned
*   **Environment Isolation**: Using in-memory databases for testing is crucial for robust CI/CD pipelines.
*   **Error Handling**: Standardizing error responses early saves time and improves the API client experience.

## Evolution of Practices
*   **Agile**: We successfully incorporated feedback from the previous retrospective into this sprint's planning.
*   **DevOps**: Our CI pipeline is now more resilient and doesn't flake due to external database dependencies.
